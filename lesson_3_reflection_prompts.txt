When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When the project is shared with other people who work on the same project.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

   In the case of automate update one might get to conflicted situation, 
   where locally changed code can conflict with remote one

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    The repository forking is the way to fork another person's repository to your own github repository
    Clone copies repository from remote to local
    Branch is somewhat tag to commits

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

	This will give opportunity to merge then local changes to remote one

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Without git only possible way would be sending changed codes to each other through mail.
    No that would not be easier, since it will cost the time.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Separate branch gives possibility to work on specific part of the code without disturbing the main stable code in the master branch
    and then merge changes to master branch.
