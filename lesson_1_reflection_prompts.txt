How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

   I have seen the differnces between these 2 files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I can trace down history of changes and get back to old version if needed

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

   The advantage is that I can logically finish some work on the fial and commit it.
   The disadvantage is that file can grow and if i forget to commit it will be hard then look at differences

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Since in that case you can see the changes that have been done to files which ara related to 
    each other. In seperate treating on is just tracing changes seperatly 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    by "git log" command I can see whole history of commits , 
    by "git diff" I can see the defferences of the next and previouse commits 

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Version control gives possibility to make errors , since in that case you return 
    to the last "clean" version of your code and spot and fix the bug 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I want to you use git for working on my projects, in parrallel with my coleagues
